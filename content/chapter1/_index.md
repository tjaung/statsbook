You see a news report that says 'a recent study shows a new experimental drug is 200% more effective compared to over the counter treatment'. What an incredible improvement! You decide to look it up for yourself and find the article. It says 'out of the 20 total participants, 4 out of 10 of the subjects in the treatment group showed signs of getting better, and only 2 out of 10 of the patients taking over-the-counter medication showed signs of getting better'. Something seems off. While the statistic is not wrong, is it really OK to conclude that the drug is 200% more effective with only 20 people? How did they measure 'getting better'? Were all the participants equally sick to begin with? 

Clearly, this is an over simplified example, but it goes to show that without proper knowledge of statistics and study design, it can be easy to deceive the public with leading stats. In an age of information and big data, we are constantly bombarded with statistics. It is more important now more than ever before to understand statistics so that we can filter biased information and make informed decisions. 

Statistics draws heavily on probability, linear and matrix algebra, and calculus. I don't believe it is necessary to completely understand these topics to apply statistics, but it is strongly recommended. I do not assume prior knowledge of these areas, but will make the occasional reference to some fundamental concepts. The goal of this website is to give simple explanations so that anybody can properly interpret statistics and learn how to apply them.
