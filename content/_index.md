# Welcome to Simplistats!

Simplistats is a website made to help people better understand applied statistics in research. Topics will include everything from fundamental concepts of statsitics and measurement to advanced models. It will also include examples of real life problems in work that school lectures may not prepare you for. 

Although there are many prerequisites to learning statistics in depth (linear and matrix algebra, calculus, probability), this site aims to simplify concepts so that even those without a deep understanding of higher math can understand. This site will also not assume any knowledge of statistical programming (SAS, R, STATA, Python, etc.), but example R codes will be available. Resources for other programming languages will be provided at the end of each page.
